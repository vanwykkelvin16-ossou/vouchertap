 * Add-to-home-screen support.

 * Two completely different worlds:
 *  - Chromium (Android, desktop) fires `beforeinstallprompt`, which we catch in
 *    an inline script in __root.tsx before hydration and stash on `window`.
 *    That stashed event is the only way to open the native install sheet, and
 *    it is single-use.
 *  - iOS has no API at all. Safari can only add to the home screen through its
 *    own Share sheet, so all we can do there is show the steps — and iOS Chrome
 *    or Firefox can't do it at all, so those users need sending to Safari.
